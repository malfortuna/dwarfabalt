Canadwarf was a fan-made game to celebrate Bronzestabbed, the SomethingAwful 2012 Dwarf Fortress Let's Play.
It was made thanks to contributions from:

OhCrap! and Crackmaster (Voices) 

Loden Taylor and Orthogonalus (Music) 

A host of goons, including the above, most of whom I guess don't want their real names posting (Testing)

and John Charity Spring (Testing, and a bunch of Good Thoughts)

The code is posted up here, along with the sound effects and music that was kindly donated by various goons. More music can be found in the thread.

The code is public domain (CC0) - do whatever you want with it, and you don't need to attribute me.
The art, with the exception of the mountain background, is also CC0.

The mountain background, all music and sound effects, are not licensed for use. If you wish to use them, please get in touch with the original posters from the Let's Play forum.
